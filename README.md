# db2_machine-learning
Scripts and code related to the use of machine learning with Db2 11.5 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows. This includes built-in ML capabilities as well as integration with 3rd party applications (for example, integration with H2O Driverless AI models and scoring pipelines).

**Samples:**
- Db2_DAI_UDF: Embeds an H2O Driverless AI Python Mojo scoring pipeline in a Db2 11.5 User Defined Function (uses Iris dataset).
- Db2_Built-in_ML-IRIS: Uses Db2's built-in ML procedures to train a decision tree model and use it for scoring (uses Iris dataset).
- Sample_Db2_Python_UDFs: Sample Db2 Python UDFs. Not necessarily ML-related.
